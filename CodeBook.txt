Below is the code book for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset morphed into a more readable code.

The final file submitted as the averages of the following 6 activities as recorded by the various machines in the data set: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_downstairs, and Walking_Upstairs

Below are the variables that were averaged by activity:
